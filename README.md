# Weighted-Multiple-Regression-Analysis-of-Sentiment-Toward-Gays

Relationship between partisanship, marital status, and sentiment toward gays in the National Election Survey.

Sample weights when we analyze this dataset to get nationally representative results

When we control for marital status it seems that partisanship still has an effect on the sentiment towards gays. The regression lines of married and unmarried respondents are parallel with only a change in the x intercept, there isn't much of a difference seen. The adjusted R-square value is .086 meaning we can only explain 8% of variation in the multiple regression model. 

Superimpose regression lines on this scatterplot that show the relationship you estimated using multiple regression analysis married respondents and unmarried respondents.
